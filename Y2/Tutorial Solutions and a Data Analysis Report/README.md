## Coursework Project Tasks

Solve every tutorial question and complete a data analysis report.

**Accomplishment:**
### Tutorial Solutions ()
#### Used UCLA HSBRAW  data set.
1. Importing/exporting data in R.
2. Quantitatively describing, summarising and plotting data in R environment.
3. Inferential statistical analyses using R.
4. Data plotting with ggplot2.
5. Exploratory data analyses using R.

### A Data Analysis Report ()
#### Used a HSAUR data set. This dataset provides mortality and water hardness for 61 cities in England and Wales.
#### Key questions answered:
1. Do either or both variables (mortality and hardness) differ between north and south cities?
2. Do mortality and water hardness statistically associated for all the 61 cities?
3. Do both variables, mortality and water hardness, also statistically associated in north and south cities, respectively?

## Software
**Utilised JAVA version 8 programming language and the NetBeans IDE in this project.**
