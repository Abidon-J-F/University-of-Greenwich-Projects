## Coursework Project Tasks

Create a Java application to find the roots of a function f(x) using prescribed numerical methods and data structures.

**Accomplishment:**
1. Created a GUI which contains a minimum and maximum range inputs, a calculate button and large output box.
2. Implemented 4 numerical methods (Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Secant and Steffensen’s) and 3 root finding function (Normal, Logarithm, Exponential Constant) to calculate the midpoint of the minimum and maximum range.
3. Once the calculation begins, two answers will be displayed. First, the simple answer is directly outputted to the output box, and the full answer is displayed to the command line.
4. Developed the output box to display the calculated midpoint answers in its first iteration form of all 4 numerical methods and its 3-root finding calculation in 6 decimal places. The command line contains the first iteration and 6 decimal places answer for all 4 numerical methods and its 3 root finding functions.
5. Developed a linked list to store Newton-Raphson and Steffensen’s answers, and an array to store Secant and Bisection answers, afterwards a text message in the command line to notify the user where their answers get stored.

## Software
**Utilised JAVA version 8 programming language and the NetBeans IDE in this project.**
