# Reinforcement Learning in Artificial Intelligence Racing Car Game

Created an artificial intelligence racing car that drives around a custom racing track by itself using a reward system to complete the racing course as a group project.

Inspiration was based on [莫烦Python] : https://morvanzhou.github.io/tutorials/

## Coursework Project Tasks

Create a simple AI project using the Python programming language and the PyCharm IDE.

**Accomplishment:**
1. Developed an Actor class to control how to agents act and Critic class measure how good it actions are using the TensorFlow library.
2. Implemented a Memory class to store every action learned from training and evaluation.
3. Applied a collision class to give the car the ability to detect the object it has collided and restart from the beginning upon to collision.
4. Used the arrays in the NumPy library to create the racing track course for the racing car to traverse in the Car class.
5. Created the car in the Car class and assigned it with optimal sensors, speed, dimension, collision response, and the ability to learn from its mistake and reward itself if does not collide with any object when racing around the course.
6. Created a Viewer Class to give the user the power to observe the race and see if the AI car is learning to overcome its failure when driving around the racing track to become perfect or is it just exploiting the reward system for its own benefit by going around in circles.
7. Used the Pyglet library to physically draw the racing track course, screen background, and car on the screen.
