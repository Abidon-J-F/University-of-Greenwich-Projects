Create HCI In-Car Music and Navigation Infotainment System Prototype using Axure RP.

**Accomplishment:**
1. Created a concept and a mid-fidelity prototype of a new in-car entertainment and navigation system that enables people to experience at least the core interactions that are available in my system in an interactive manner. 
2. Included access to music and navigation services in this interactive prototype.
4. Designed desirable interactions in-car features based on my background readings and research activities.
5. The target audience found this interactive prototype to be usable and desirable for their daily commute.
