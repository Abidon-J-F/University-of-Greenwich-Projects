Created the notebook program to record notes and classify them by modules, topic, and date. Added a search bar the user can use to search useful pieces of information.

We programmed our notebook to do the following tasks:
1.	Adds a module to the list of existing modules and creating a folder for it.
2.	Adding a list of coursework requirements expected for each module.
3.	Adding a list of requirements for a specific coursework.
4.	Adding notes to each requirement 
5.	Adding deadlines dates for each coursework.
6.	Outputting those notes as a text document file in their appropriate folder so that it can imported into a  word-processed document.

JAVA version 8 and the NetBeans IDE was utilised in making this project.
